# What's new in Windows 11 IoT Enterprise?

Windows 11 IoT Enterprise is the next evolution of Windows IoT; it is the most significant update to the Windows operating system since Windows 10. It offers many innovations focused on enhancing end-user experience that is flexible and fluid. Windows 11 IoT Enterprise is designed to support today's hybrid world, and intended to be the most reliable, secure, connected, and performant Windows operating system ever.

Windows 11 IoT Enterprise is built on the same foundation as Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, so the investments you have made in tools for update and device management are carried forward. Windows 11 IoT Enterprise also sustains the application compatibility promise made with the Windows 10 operating systems.

This article will walk you through the latest updates for Windows 11 IoT Enterprise and what device builders and OEMs should know about this latest offering.

## Licensing
There are no unique licensing requirements for Windows 11 IoT Enterprise beyond what is required for Windows 11 IoT Enterprise devices.

Windows 11 IoT Enterprise will only be available as a [Annual release](../iot-enterprise/Commercialization/Licensing.md#Semi-Annual-Channel-SAC). Please contact your distributor for more information.

## Compatibility
Most accessories and associated drivers that work with Windows 10 IoT Enterprise are expected to work with Windows 11 IoT Enterprise. Check with your accessory manufacturer for specific details.

As mentioned above, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise preserves the application compatibility promise made with Windows 10 operating systems, and does not require changes to existing support processes or tooling to sustain the currency of applications and devices.

## Familiar processes
Windows 11 IoT Enterprise is built on the same foundation as Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. Typically, you can use the same tools and solutions you use today to deploy, manage, and secure your Windows 11 IoT Enterprise device. Your current management tools and processes will also work to manage monthly quality updates for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 IoT devices.

> Please see [Prepare for Windows 11](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/windows-11-prepare#infrastructure-and-tools) for more details on infrastructure and tools nuanced differences in regards to [on-premise solutions (WSUS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/windows-11-prepare#on-premises-solutions) or [Cloud-based solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/windows-11-prepare#cloud-based-solutions).

## Servicing

Like Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise will receive monthly quality updates. However, it will have a new feature update cadence. Windows 11 feature updates will be released once per year, thus the semi-annual cadence for Windows 10 IoT Enterprise will remain, but starting with Windows 11 IoT Enterprise, there will only be an annual release.  

When Windows 11 OS reaches general availability, important servicing-related announcements and information about known issues and safeguard holds can be found on the [Windows release health hub](https://aka.ms/windowsreleasehealth). Monthly release notes will also be available from a consolidated Windows 11 update history page at that time. For more information, see [Servicing and support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/windows-11-plan#servicing-and-support).

## New Features and Functionality Updates
With every new operating system, comes exciting new features and capabilities - Windows 11 IoT Enterprise is no different.

### WSLg
With Windows 11 IoT Enterprise, customers will be able to take advantage of the highly anticipated feature, WSLg, which brings Linux GUI applications to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

WSL lets you run a Linux environment, and up until this point has focused on enabling command line tools utilities and applications. GUI app support now lets you use your favorite Linux GUI applications as well. WSL is used in a wide variety of applications, workloads, and use cases to learn more, check out the [announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/the-initial-preview-of-gui-app-support-is-now-available-for-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2/) and [blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wslg-architecture/).  


### USB 4.0
Windows 11 IoT Enterprise brings support to USB 4.


### Wi-Fi 6
Windows 11 IoT Enterprise brings Wi-Fi 6 support to IoT devices. Wi-Fi 6 gives you better wireless coverage and performance with added security.

### Assigned Access Multi-App Kiosk Mode
In this first release of Windows 11 IoT Enterprise, the [assigned access multi-app kiosk mode](../iot-enterprise/Kiosk-Mode/Multi-App-Kiosk.md) functionality will not be available. However, customers can still use assigned access multi-app kiosk mode on Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. [Assigned access single-App kiosk mode](../iot-enterprise/Kiosk-Mode/Single-App-Kiosk.md) and [Shell Launcher]((../iot-enterprise/Kiosk-Mode/Shell-Launcher.md) are still fully functional in Windows 11 IoT Enterprise.
